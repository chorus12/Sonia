Generation of music using autoencoders.

This repository contains all follow-up materials, such as .ipynb labs, Kaggle competitions submission notebooks, and other stuff that gives enough foundation for the project.

Quick note on usage of the project:
1. python3 inference.py
2. Enter random seed, "density rate" (float number from 0 to 1, the lower - the denser, 0.25 is optimal for most cases) and output directory.
3. Generated music (.mid and .wav) would lie in the provided folder.
